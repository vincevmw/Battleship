-----Vincent Weinberger's Battleship-----

////////////

I've hidden a button just above the copyright section at the bottom of the page.  Hover over it and click it and it will generate the database using the following credentials:

servername: localhost
username: root
password:

database name is: battleshipvw

It performs this action using the "init.php" file (in case you would like to alter it).

Timeline & Contributions:

I worked on my own on this project in order to gain as much experience as possible!
Although this may have come back to bite me because I did not get as much time to work on it as I thought I would due to having three other "Final Projects" this semester.
Most of the work done on this project was done within the last few days prior to turning it in.  I believe I will be able to finish before I present on Thursday, but as of right now I regret to say that it is unfinished.  
Finished Implementations:

	Script to create database and tables. (help.html, init.php)
	Main Menu with Login, Register, Help, and About pages. (index.php, login.php, register.php, help.html, about.html)
	Login and Registration system. (index.php, login.php, logout.php, register.php, session.php)
	Matchmaking system. (findMatch.php, findMatchHelper.php, session.php
	Displaying game on screen. (js/gameState.js, game.php)
	CSS (styles.css)
	
	

I am grateful for having this project, though as I learned a lot (jQuery is amazing!).  I also learned just how much time needs to go into a large project like this in order to fully implement and style the pages to a satisfactory level. I am looking forward to future projects so that I can practice better pacing and learn even more quick and efficient ways of creating websites and applications!
