				<p id="bio">Hello!  My name is Vincent Weinberger.  I am a senior at Fresno State and will be graduating in Spring 2021.  My goal is to be able to create 
				more fun web applications like this one for a living.  Web Development has very much begun to interest me due to the fact that what you code can be immediately
				visible and interact-able for the user.  This is my Battleship game that I created for my Web Programming class in the Fall 2020 semester.  
				I had a lot of fun creating this game and I hope that you have fun playing it as well! <a id="email" href="mailto:vincevmw@mail.fresnostate.edu">Email me</a>
