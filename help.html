						<li class="ruleslistitem">Battleship - This game is played between two players, both with two boards visible to them: Their own board and a board representing their opponent's board.</li>
						<li class="ruleslistitem">Before Turn One - Each player will secretly arrange ships on their board.  There are five different types of ships to deploy, 
						each taking up a specific amount of consecutive squares on the board:
							<ol>
								<li class="ruleslistitem">A CARRIER of size 5</li>
								<li class="ruleslistitem">A BATTLESHIP of size 4</li>
								<li class="ruleslistitem">A DESTROYER of size 3</li>
								<li class="ruleslistitem">A SUBMARINE of size 3</li>
								<li class="ruleslistitem">A PATROL BOAT of size 2</li>
							</ol>
						</li class="ruleslistitem">
						<li class="ruleslistitem">Superpowers - In this iteration of the game there are two "Superpowers" that may be used.  They are as follows:
							<ol>
								<li class="ruleslistitem">Send 3 torpedoes in one turn</li>
								<li class="ruleslistitem">Send a giant torpedo of total size 5 that explodes in the shape of a "+".</li>
							</ol>
							Each player may use only ONE of these Superpowers ONE time per game.  And only if the player has exactly TWO ships remaining on the board.
						</li class="ruleslistitem">
						<li class="ruleslistitem">Taking Turns - After each player's ships have been placed on their board, a player will be chosen at random to become the first active player and begin the game.  
						From that point on, players alternate turns, launching torpedoes at the position specified by the active player.  An "X" will be marked on both the opponent's own board 
						and also the active player's board that corresponds to the opponent's board.  If the torpedo hits an opposing ship, the "X" will be red.  If not, it will be black.</li>
						<li class="ruleslistitem">Sinking Ships - If a ship has been hit by a torpedo at each of its positions, it has been sunk.</li>
						<li class="ruleslistitem">The game is won by the player who sinks every ship on his opponent's board.</li>
